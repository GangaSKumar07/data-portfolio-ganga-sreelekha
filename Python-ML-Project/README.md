**Land Price Prediction Model (Machine Learning)**
A machine learning regression model built to predict land prices based on features such as location, area, road access, and property attributes.

**Objective**
Predict land prices accurately using a supervised regression algorithm.

**Model Workflow**
> Data cleaning – Handle missing values & outliers
> Feature engineering – Encode categorical variables
> Train-test split
> Model training using algorithms such as:
      Linear Regression
      Random Forest Regressor
