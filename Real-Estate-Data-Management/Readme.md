# Real Estate Data Management Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates my skills in **Excel** and **Power BI** through a comprehensive real estate data management project. The project focuses on managing and analyzing data for **landlords, properties, clients, and transactions**, with actionable insights for property management and revenue optimization.

## Excel Tasks

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked for duplicates and blanks to ensure data integrity.
- Standardized formats for easy analysis.

### 2. Data Linking
- Used **XLOOKUP/VLOOKUP** to connect datasets:
  - **Properties ↔ Landlords**
  - **Transactions ↔ Clients**

### 3. Pivot Tables
- **Total Rent by City**
- **Occupied vs Available Properties**
- **Revenue by Property Type**

### 4. Data Validation
- Created dropdowns for:
  - `Property_Status` (Available, Occupied, etc.)
  - `Property_Type` (Residential, Commercial, etc.)

### 5. Conditional Formatting
- Highlighted **high-rent properties**
- Flagged **inactive landlords** for follow-up
